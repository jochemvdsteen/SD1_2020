Try to do the following using the example code 
and information you find online.
When you are get stuck don't stop but ask your classmate or teacher. 
--------------------------------------

Part 1: Directions...
  1. Create an enumerable type named 'Directions' containing all 4 directions north, south, east and west.
     Tip : Enums are defined before the Main method.
  
Part 2: 
  1. Declare a variable named 'playerDirection' of the enum 'Directions' type.
  2. Ask the user to input one of the available directions.
  3. Use an if statment to check the input and display a different message for every possible option.
  
Part 3:
  1. Do the same as Part 2 but use the enum value instead of the name.
  2. If you're feeling adventurous you can try to use a foreach to create the menu from the enum

Save you work to OneDrive or, preferably, GitHub for Werkhouding points.
Good luck!!!
